## Installing VueJS under Linux Mint

1. Open your terminal
2. Type "npm install -g @vue/cli"
3. Type "npm update -g @vue/cli"
4. Under Linux Mint, you might want to open a file as a root user (===> right click, ===> open as root) and run the terminal from there
5. Go to the [official documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html) if you need it
